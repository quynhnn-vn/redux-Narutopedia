# React Redux Project: Narutopedia
Practicing using Redux Toolkit by creating a news reader app for Naruto's characters:
- The app fetches and displays a list of all Naruto's characters in their preview form.
- It fetches and displays the current article which can be selected and changed by user.
- User can view and comment on various articles.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template and [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) to replicate the functionality of an external API.
